<h2>Fun Facts About This Bear</h2>
<p>I have been in the WordPress industry for over 7 years now.  
I have been marketing in this industry for a majority of that time.  
I have recently decided to learn how to code so that I can one day be a full stack web 
developer.  I know, you probably have never seen a bear code before.</p>
<br><i>P.S. I also am a rival ranked Demon Hunter.</i>
